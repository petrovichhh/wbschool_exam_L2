This repository contains solutions for Level 2 WB Tech assignments, implemented in the Golang programming language.

## Assignments

The assignments include the implementation of various design patterns and the development of various programs. Each program must pass all tests, and the code must pass `go vet` and `golint` checks.

## Running Tests

To run the tests for any task, navigate to the corresponding task folder within the `src` directory and use the `go test` command. For example:

```bash
cd develop/<task folder name>
go test
```

Replace `<task folder name>` with the name of the task folder for which you want to run the tests. This command will run all tests in the specified folder.
